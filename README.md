# Hello! I'm John!

I'm a self-taught data professional from Minneapolis, Minnesota. I have a strong background in both analytics, data, and product management with professional experience at UPS and Cargill. I am also the owner of my consulting firm, [Corvid Analytics](https://corvidanalytics.com), where I specialize in providing data-driven solutions to help small businesses work with their data.

In my personal life, I have a passion for reading and am a classically trained flutist. I have recently taken up birdwatching as a hobby and have enjoyed learning about different species and their behaviors.

I was married to my wife Ashley in 2021 and we are the proud owners of a sweet [dog named Finn](https://www.instagram.com/thedognamedfinn/). In my free time, I enjoy spending quality time with my family and friends, and am always looking for new ways to learn and grow.
